# harz-deforestation-eopf

Motivation: 
In the area of the "Harz Naturschutzgebiet" there was a lot of monoculture of certain tree species, particularly vulnurable to insect disease, which in turn lead to a huge deforestation of the area starting around 2018. As this is within the timeframe of Sentinel-2, it would be interesting to see how the deforestation affected the area. 

The goal is to see the effects of the dying monoculture of trees, aswell as trying to see the new growth for a more sustainable forest, which is currently growing. The question is, how easy it is to see, especially as the new trees are still in the initial growth phase. 

In terms of the working environment, we would like to generate thematic files, which we can then use to come together and integrate them to a fully fledged report. The standard procedure should be defined together, then we split into (mostly) solo work and then we come together to integrate the results.

Interesting topics: 
- Deforestation
- Influence on air quality
- Influence on heat retention
- Influence on land slides frequency
  - Newspaper-Database to enrich dataset 
- Influence on Biodiversity
- Temporal-spatial analysis of respective areas
- Spread of bark beetle?
  - Maybe: Other dataset containing exactly that --> Trees dying = beetle is there
  - Compare areas that are not affected, even though it is still forest (maybe even monoculture) 

Roles: 

- Current selection of topics:

Phil: deforestation, air quality, land slides

Aarya: Heat retention

Randy: Biodiversity
