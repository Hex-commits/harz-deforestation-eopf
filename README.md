# harz-deforestation-eopf

Motivation: 
In the area of the "Harz Naturschutzgebiet" there was a lot of monoculture of certain tree species, particularly vulnurable to insect disease, which in turn lead to a huge deforestation of the area starting around 2018. As this is within the timeframe of Sentinel-2, it would be interesting to see how the deforestation affected the area.
