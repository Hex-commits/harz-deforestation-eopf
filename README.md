# harz-deforestation-eopf

Motivation: 
In the area of the "Harz Naturschutzgebiet" there was a lot of monoculture of certain tree species, particularly vulnurable to insect disease, which in turn lead to a huge deforestation of the area starting around 2018. As this is within the timeframe of Sentinel-2, it would be interesting to see how the deforestation affected the area. 

Interesting topics: 
- Deforestation
- Influence on air quality
- Influence on heat retention
- Influence on land slides frequency
  - Newspaper-Database to enrich dataset 
- Influence on Biodiversity
- Temporal-spatial analysis of respective areas
- Spread of bark beetle?
  - Maybe: Other dataset containing exactly that --> Trees dying = beetle is there
  - Compare areas that are not affected, even though it is still forest (maybe even monoculture)
